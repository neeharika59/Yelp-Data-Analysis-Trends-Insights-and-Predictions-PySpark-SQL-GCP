This project analyzes Yelp's dataset of 6M+ reviews across 150,000+ businesses to uncover patterns in consumer behavior and business performance. Using Spark for data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques, we examined the relationship between user reviews and business attributes.

Key findings reveal high user engagement in Pennsylvania and Florida, with restaurants leading in review volume. Cities like Philadelphia and New Orleans stand out for exceptional dining experiences, while niche categories like Mohels and Patent Law receive the highest ratings. We also observed a significant drop in reviews post-2019, likely due to COVID-19â€™s impact. These insights help businesses refine marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and adapt to emerging trends.
